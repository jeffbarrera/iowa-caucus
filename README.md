# Predicting the GOP Iowa Caucuses

A statistical model to predict vote shares for Republican candidates in the 2016 Iowa Caucus, written in a mix of R and Python. Created by Jeff Barrera and Jacob Fenton as a project for _PoliSci 355B: Machine Learning for Social Scientists_, taught by Justin Grimmer at Stanford University.

An explanation of our model is available at https://github.com/jeffbarrera/iowa-caucus/blob/master/writeup.pdf.

The R replication code for our final model is at the top of this R Markdown file: https://github.com/jeffbarrera/iowa-caucus/blob/master/writeup.Rmd

The Python scripts to generate the Epanechnikov estimates are:
